# T2 1MRC
Idea inspired (or stolen) by the [1BRC](https://1brc.dev) challenge, I've setup a 1-million-row-challenge for you to solve in Python.
Your task is to write a program that parses the `measurements.txt` file to calculate the minimum, maximum and average temperatures in each city. 

Some example from `measurements.txt`:
```
Nässjö;89.1
Nässjö;12.6
Trollhättan;37.9
Trollhättan;33.4
Vänersborg;11.7
```

Your program should produce an output in this format:
```
Nässjö;12.6;50.8;89.1
Trollhättan;33.4;35,6;37.9
Vänersborg;11.7;11.7;11.7
```

# Getting started
Open the provided `main.py` file in your text-editor or IDE of choice and start coding :)
I recommend putting your code inside the `def main():` function.
