# T2 1MRC
Idea inspired (or stolen) by the [1BRC](https://1brc.dev) challenge, I've setup a 1-million-row-challenge for you to solve in Python.
Your task is to write a program that parses the `measurements.txt` file to calculate the minimum, maximum and average temperatures in each city. 

Some example from `measurements.txt`:
```
Nässjö;89.1
Nässjö;12.6
Trollhättan;37.9
Trollhättan;33.4
Vänersborg;11.7
```

Your program should produce an output in this format:
```
Nässjö;12.6;50.8;89.1
Trollhättan;33.4;35,6;37.9
Vänersborg;11.7;11.7;11.7
```

# Getting started
Download the git repository to a local folder. If you have git installed, you can run the following command in your terminal (cmd.exe) to download and open the folder:
```
C:\Users\emieli> git clone https://github.com/emieli/t2-1mrc.git
Cloning into 't2-1mrc'...
[...]
Receiving objects: 100% (8/8), 7.40 MiB | 23.18 MiB/s, done.

C:\Users\emieli> code t2-1mrc
(OR)
C:\Users\emieli> explorer t2-1mrc
```
*You now have a local copy of the GIT repository.*

If you have VS-code installed then you can type `code t2-1mrc` in cmd to open the project. 

If you don't have VS-code then you can type `explorer t2-1mrc` in cmd to open the directory in your file explorer.

You can now open `t2-1mrc\main.py` and start coding!
